"""
Contains utility functions for working with nested python data structures.

A *pytree* is Python nested data structure. It is a tree in the sense that
nodes are Python collections (e.g., list, tuple, dict) and the leaves are
Python values. Furthermore, a pytree should not contain reference cycles.

pytrees are useful for working with nested collections of Tensors. For example,
one can use `tree_map` to map a function over all Tensors inside some nested
collection of Tensors and `tree_leaves` to get a flat list of all Tensors
inside some nested collection. pytrees are helpful for implementing nested
collection support for PyTorch APIs.
